# StartPage
Based on this [Start Page](https://github.com/fukouda/Startpage).

#### Features
On top of the original, I've added few upgrades to it.
- The bottom two boxes has columns, four and three columns respectively.
- There is a dropdown list of styles to change in top right corner.
    - The selected style will persistent as it gets saved to HTML5's localStorage.
- The textbox no longer is a simple search box. It's a functioning command line basedon [this](https://github.com/WillEccles/startpage).
    - [Here](commands.txt) is a list of default commands to use in command line (Note: it does not list any user-defined commands).
    - To create your own custom commands, go [here](tutorials/custom_commands.md).
- The commands and links are located in json file and should no longer be affected by any changes to index.html or function.js.
    - This allows users to retain their customizations in future updates (with little or no changes required).
    - To add your own links, go [here](tutorials/custom_links.md).https://github.com/mrawlingst/StartPage/blob/develop/tutorials/custom_links.md
    
#### Issues
- Styles dropdown list does not update the selected item to current style in a new session.
- ~~Changing search engine does not persisent after current session. It will always default back to DuckDuckGo~~.

#### Styles
The links will take you to a screenshot of the style.
