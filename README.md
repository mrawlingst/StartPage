# StartPage
Based on this [Start Page](https://github.com/fukouda/Startpage).

#### Features
On top of the original, I've added few upgrades to it.
- The bottom two boxes has columns, four and three columns respectively.
- There is a dropdown list of styles to change in top right corner.
    - The selected style will persistent as it gets saved to HTML5's localStorage.
- I made DuckDuckGo my main search engine (Google isn't removed, just not the primary engine).
    
#### Issues
- Styles dropdown list does not update the selected item to current style in a new session.
- Changing search engine does not persisent after current session. It will always default back to DuckDuckGo.

#### Styles
The links will take you to a screenshot of the style.
- [Link & Zelda](screenshots/screenshot-link&zelda.png) - actually is the original style from [here](https://github.com/fukouda/Startpage).
- [Blues](screenshots/screenshot-blues.png) - created by CursedShadow
- [MiniBlack](screenshots/screenshot-miniblack.png) - created by me.

More to come.
